Google Design Guidelines (Material Design)
===========================================

TYPOGRAPHY
----------
- Primary font: Google Sans (or Roboto as fallback)
- Font weights used: 400 (Regular), 500 (Medium), 700 (Bold)
- Body text: 14–16px, line-height ~1.5
- Headlines: large and bold, but not decorative — always readable
- Avoid using more than 2 font weights on a single screen

SPACING & LAYOUT
----------------
- Base spacing unit: 8px (all spacing should be multiples of 8: 8, 16, 24, 32...)
- Content max-width: ~1200–1280px, centered on wide screens
- Generous padding inside cards and sections
- No clutter — Google prefers lots of white space

ELEVATION & SHADOWS
--------------------
- Surfaces use subtle box-shadows to indicate elevation, not heavy drop shadows
- Example card shadow: box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,0.12), 0 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.08)
- Higher elevation = slightly more blur and spread, but always soft

BUTTONS
-------
- Primary action: filled button using Medium Blue (#4285F4), white text
- Secondary action: outlined button with border, transparent background
- Text buttons: no border, no fill — just colored text (used for low-emphasis actions)
- Border radius on buttons: 4px (slightly rounded, not pill-shaped unless it's a chip)
- No uppercase text on buttons (Google dropped ALL CAPS in newer Material 3)

CARDS
-----
- Background: white (#FFFFFF) on a Light Grey (#F1F3F4) page background
- Border: none (use shadow for separation instead)
- Border radius: 8px on cards
- Padding inside cards: 16–24px

ICONS
-----
- Use Google's Material Symbols / Material Icons (rounded style preferred)
- Icons should be 18px, 20px, or 24px — consistent sizing throughout
- Icon color should match text color or use Grey (#9AA0A6) for secondary icons

INTERACTIVE STATES
------------------
- Hover: light grey overlay (rgba(0,0,0,0.04)) on the element
- Focus: visible ring, usually Blue (#4285F4) at low opacity
- Active/Pressed: slightly darker overlay
- Disabled: reduced opacity (~38%), not hidden

BORDERS & DIVIDERS
------------------
- Use Light Grey (#F1F3F4) or a 1px #E0E0E0 line for dividers
- Avoid heavy borders — prefer whitespace to separate sections
- Input fields: 1px border, grey by default, blue on focus

DARK MODE (if applicable)
--------------------------
- Background: #202124 (Google's dark surface)
- Surface/card: #303134
- Text: #E8EAED (primary), #9AA0A6 (secondary)
- Accent colors remain the same (Medium Blue, etc.)

OVERALL PRINCIPLES
------------------
- Clean and minimal — remove anything that doesn't serve a purpose
- Color is used to draw attention, not decorate
- Accessibility first: contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 for body text
- Consistent component behavior across the whole UI
- Mobile-first responsive design


User-Centric Design
===================

VISUAL HIERARCHY
----------------
- Make the most important element the biggest and boldest on the page
- Each step down in importance = lower visual weight (smaller, lighter, less contrast)
- Don't force reading patterns (F-pattern is outdated) — guide users naturally through hierarchy
- CTAs/buttons must have high contrast from surrounding elements so they stand out

BUTTONS & CALLS TO ACTION
--------------------------
- Never use ghost buttons (outline-only, no fill) — users don't notice or click them
- The primary action should always be a solid filled button
- Use the accent color (10% rule) for CTAs so they pop against the rest of the page

COLOR: 60-30-10 RULE
---------------------
- 60% dominant/neutral colors (greys, whites, blacks)
- 30% brand colors
- 10% accent color — reserved for CTAs, highlights, and key interactions

TYPOGRAPHY FOR READABILITY
---------------------------
- H1: biggest, most prominent — describes what the whole page is about
- H2: subheadings to break up content and guide scanning
- Body/P: never use decorative fonts — prioritize readability over style

CONVERSION & REDUCING FRICTION
--------------------------------
- Design goal = make it stupid easy for users to find what they need and take action
- Be crystal clear: who is this, what should I do, why should I care
- People scan, they don't read — use layout and hierarchy to support scanning
- Design must motivate the user, not just look good — speak to what drives their decision

DESIGN FOR THE USER, NOT YOURSELF
-----------------------------------
- It doesn't matter if you or the client loves the design — the visitor is who matters
- Choose fonts, colors, and layout based on the target audience's expectations
- Do research on who is actually using the site before making design decisions
